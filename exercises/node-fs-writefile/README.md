# node-fs-writefile

This exercise expands on use of the `fs` Node.js module after its introduction in [`node-fs-readfile`](../node-fs-readfile).

### Quiz

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What method is available in the Node.js `fs` module for writing data to a file?
- Are file operations using the `fs` module synchronous or asynchronous?

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (from `master`) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md). Then navigate to the `exercises/node-fs-writefile` directory in your terminal.

### Exercise

#### Level 1 (Required)

1. Read about [`fs.writeFile`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v10.x/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writefile_file_data_options_callback) in the official Node.js documentation.
1. Create a new file named `write-rand.js`.
1. Within `write-rand.js`, use `fs.writeFile` to write a [random number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) to a new file named `random.txt`.
1. Execute `write-rand.js` with the `node` command. A new, random number should be written to `random.txt` each time you execute `write-rand.js`.

#### Level 2 (Required)

1. Create a new file named `note-to-self.js`.
1. Within `note-to-self.js`, use `fs.writeFile` and [`process.argv`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v10.x/api/process.html#process_process_argv) to accept input from the user to write to a new file named `note.txt`.
1. After executing `note-to-self.js`, verify the contents of `note.txt`.

#### Level 3 (Optional) - DO AFTER TURNING IN LEVELS 1 AND 2

1. Create a new file named `cp.js`.
1. Within `cp.js`, use `fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`, and `process.argv` to copy one file to another file.
