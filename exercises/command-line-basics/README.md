# command-line-basics

This exercise covers some basic command-line literacy for [UNIX-like operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like). It primarily focuses on manipulation of files and directories.

### Before You Begin

Be sure to check out a new branch (from `master`) for this exercise. Detailed instructions can be found [**here**](../../guides/before-each-exercise.md). Then navigate to the `exercises/command-line-basics` directory in your terminal.

### Introduction

Many computer users today are accustomed to a specific type of interface: a [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) _aka_ GUI. However, applications that use a GUI are usually aimed at _consumers_ of technology (end users), not _producers_ of technology (developers). There are certainly many GUI-based applications in wide use by developers. This lesson was authored using a GUI text editor (VS Code). **However, GUI-based applications are not always readily available for performing technical tasks.**

Many new developers feel intimidated by [command-line interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). A CLI may be particularly alien to you if you've grown up using GUIs your entire life. But as you become more comfortable using the command-line, you'll probably find that you become more efficient and more precise while controlling your computer to perform development tasks.

### Exercise

During this exercise you will be looking up command information with the `man` command. `man` is an interface to the on-line reference manuals. Try it out!

```bash
man man
```

Use the up and down arrows (or PgUp and PgDn) to scroll the page. Press `space` to jump down a page at a time. Press `q` to close the manual.

#### `cat`

1. Use your terminal to open the user manual for the `cat` command.
    ```bash
    man cat
    ```
1. Read the `NAME`, `SYNOPSIS`, and `DESCRIPTION` sections. Only read the first part of the description. If you want, you can scan the options list, but we won't be using any of those options for now.
1. Use the `cat` command to print the contents of `laziness.txt`, `impatience.txt`, and `hubris.txt` one-by-one to your terminal.
1. Use the `cat` command to combine the contents of those files and print the result to the terminal.
1. Use the `cat` command to combine the contents of those files and write the result to a new file named `three-virtues.txt` like this:
    ```bash
    cat laziness.txt impatience.txt hubris.txt > three-virtues.txt
    ```
1. Use the `cat` command to print the contents of your new `three-virtues.txt` file to the terminal.

#### `ls`

1. Use your terminal to open the user manual for the `ls` command.
    ```bash
    man ls
    ```
1. Read the `NAME`, `SYNOPSIS`, and `DESCRIPTION` sections. Only read the introductory paragraphs of the description as well as the `-a` and `-F` options for now.
1. Use the `ls` command to list the contents of your current working directory. Try it again with the `-a` and `-F` options.
1. Use the `ls` command to list the contents of the `lfz-staff/` directory. **You do not need to `cd` into a directory to list its contents!** Try it again with the `-a` and `-F` options.
1. Use the `ls` command to list the contents of the `lfz-staff/` directory and write the results to a new file at `lfz-staff/contents.txt` like this:
    ```bash
    ls -aF lfz-staff > lfz-staff/contents.txt
    ```
1. Use the `cat` command to print contents of your new `lfz-staff/contents.txt` file to the terminal.

#### `pwd`

1. Use your terminal to open the user manual for the `pwd` command.
    ```bash
    man pwd
    ```
1. Read the `NAME`, `SYNOPSIS`, and `DESCRIPTION` sections.
1. Use the `pwd` command to print your current working directory.
1. Use the `pwd` command to write your current working directory to a new file named `i-was-here.txt` like this:
    ```bash
    pwd > i-was-here.txt
    ```
1. Use the `ls` command to list the contents of your current working directory, it should include the new file you just created.
1. Use the `cat` command to print the contents of `i-was-here.txt` to the terminal.

#### `echo`

1. Use your terminal to open the user manual for the `echo` command.
    ```bash
    man echo
    ```
1. Read the `NAME`, `SYNOPSIS`, and `DESCRIPTION` sections. Only read the first bit of the description, it's not useful to read through all of the options right now.
1. Use the `echo` command to print the string `'Hello, World!'` to the terminal.
1. Use the `echo` command to write the string `'Hello, World!'` to a new file named `hello.txt` like this:
    ```bash
    echo 'Hello, World!' > hello.txt
    ```
1. Use the `ls` command to list the contents of your current working directory, it should include the new file you just created.
1. Use the `cat` command to print the contents of `hello.txt` to the terminal.

#### `touch`

1. Use your terminal to open the user manual for the `touch` command.
    ```bash
    man touch
    ```
1. Read the `NAME`, `SYNOPSIS`, and `DESCRIPTION` sections. You can ignore the options for now.
1. Use the `touch` command to create a new file named `tag-youre-it.txt`.
1. Use the `touch` command to create a new file named `boop.txt` inside of the `snoot/` directory. **You do not need to `cd` into a directory to create a file inside it.**
1. Use the `ls` command to list the contents of the `snoot/` directory.

#### `mkdir`

1. Use your terminal to open the user manual for the `mkdir` command.
    ```bash
    man mkdir
    ```
1. Read the `NAME`, `SYNOPSIS`, and `DESCRIPTION` sections. You can ignore all of the options except `-p` for now.
1. Use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory named `parent`.
1. Use the `ls` command to verify that your `parent/` directory has been created.
1. Use the `mkdir` command with the `-p` option to create nested `parent/child/grandchild` directories.
1. Use the `touch` command to create a `.gitkeep` file inside of `parent/child/grandchild` so that the directories are added when you commit. Git ignores empty directories.

#### `mv`

1. Use your terminal to open the user manual for the `mv` command.
    ```bash
    man mv

    ```bash
    man cp
    ```
1. Read the `NAME`, `SYNOPSIS`, and `DESCRIPTION` sections. You can ignore all of the options, but you might be interested in the `-r` option in the future.
